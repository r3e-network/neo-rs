# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest `master` branch and the most recent tagged release are eligible for security fixes. Older releases may receive fixes on a best-effort basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Email: `security@r3e.network`
- Please include a clear description, reproduction steps, and any proof-of-concept material. Avoid filing public GitHub issues for suspected vulnerabilities.
- We will acknowledge receipt within 5 business days and provide a remediation timeline once triaged.

## Disclosure

We prefer coordinated disclosure. If a fix requires a public advisory, we will work with you on timing and credit. Thank you for helping keep the Neo Rust node secure.
