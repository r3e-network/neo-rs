# Monitor node status
tail -f neo-node-safe.log

# Test RPC functionality
curl -X POST http://localhost:30332/rpc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"getversion","params":[],"id":1}'

# Check node health
ps aux | grep neo-node

# Stop node safely
kill $(cat neo-node.pid)

# Restart node
./start-node-safe.sh
```

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Key health indicators (all GREEN):
