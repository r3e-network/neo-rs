# Contributing to Neo-RS

We welcome contributions to Neo-RS! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. Please treat all contributors with respect and create a welcoming environment for everyone.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/neo-rs.git
   cd neo-rs
   ```
3. Set up the development environment:
   ```bash
   # Install Rust if you haven't already
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   
   # Install system dependencies
   # Ubuntu/Debian:
   sudo apt-get install build-essential clang librocksdb-dev
   
   # macOS:
   brew install rocksdb
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --workspace
   ```
5. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test --workspace
   ```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow Rust standard formatting: `cargo fmt`
- Address all clippy warnings: `cargo clippy --workspace`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write comprehensive documentation for public APIs
- Keep functions focused and small when possible

### Testing

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Ensure existing tests continue to pass
- Aim for high test coverage
- Include both unit tests and integration tests where appropriate
- Test error conditions and edge cases

### Documentation

- Document all public APIs with rustdoc comments
- Include examples in documentation where helpful
- Update the README.md if adding significant features
- Keep CHANGELOG.md updated

### Performance

- Profile performance-critical code changes
- Avoid unnecessary allocations in hot paths
- Use benchmarks to validate performance improvements
- Consider memory usage implications

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from main:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following the guidelines above

3. Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new transaction validation logic
   
   - Implement additional validation checks for transaction signatures
   - Add comprehensive test coverage for edge cases
   - Update documentation with new validation rules"
   ```

4. Push your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. Open a Pull Request on GitHub with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Detailed description of what was changed and why
   - Reference to any related issues
   - Screenshots or examples if applicable

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code restructuring
- `test:` for adding tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks
