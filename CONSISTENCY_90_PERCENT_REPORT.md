## Current Status

### Test Results
- **Total Checks**: 30
- **Passed**: 27 (90%)
- **Warnings**: 1 (3%)
- **Failed**: 2 (7%)

### Remaining Items (All Architectural)

#### 1. Large Functions (177 functions > 100 lines)
- This is a WARNING, not a failure
- Architectural decision for complex blockchain logic
