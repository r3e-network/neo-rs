# Neo VM Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing approach for ensuring complete functional equivalence between the Neo C# VM and the Rust VM implementation. It provides a structured methodology for validating that the Rust VM behaves identically to the reference C# implementation.

## Testing Principles

1. **Behavioral Equivalence**: The Rust VM must produce identical results to the C# VM for the same inputs.
2. **Edge Case Coverage**: Tests must cover edge cases, error conditions, and performance boundaries.
3. **Cross-Implementation Validation**: Test suites must be executable against both implementations.
4. **Deterministic Results**: Tests must produce deterministic results across runs.
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test coverage should aim for 100% of the codebase.

## Testing Levels

### Level 1: Unit Tests

Unit tests verify the behavior of individual VM components in isolation.

#### Stack Item Tests

- Creation and basic properties
- Type conversion
- Deep copy operations
- Equality comparisons
- Serialization/deserialization

#### OpCode Tests

- Operand size validation
- Stack effect calculation
- Instruction parsing

#### Execution Engine Tests

- Context management
- Stack operations
- Exception handling
- State transitions

### Level 2: Component Integration Tests

These tests verify the integration between VM components.

- OpCode execution with stack manipulation
- Execution context with evaluation stack
- Jump table with instruction execution
- Reference counting across operations

### Level 3: Script Execution Tests

These tests execute complete scripts and verify results.

- Simple arithmetic operations
- Control flow (jumps, calls, returns)
- Exception handling
- Complex data structure manipulation
- Nested loops and conditions

### Level 4: Cross-Implementation Compatibility Tests

These tests explicitly verify compatibility between C# and Rust implementations.

- Script execution with identical results
- Exception generation and handling
- Memory management behavior
- Stack manipulation effects

## Test Data Sources

1. **Standard Test Scripts**: A set of standard scripts that exercise all VM features
2. **Generated Test Cases**: Programmatically generated test cases for edge conditions
3. **Real-World Contracts**: Actual Neo smart contracts from the blockchain
4. **Malformed Scripts**: Deliberately malformed scripts to test error handling

## Test Implementation Techniques

### Cross-Implementation Testing Framework

A framework to execute the same tests across both implementations:

1. Script input generation
2. Execution in both VMs
3. Result comparison
4. Detailed reporting of any differences

### Snapshot Testing

For complex operations:

1. Capture the entire VM state at specific points
2. Compare snapshots between implementations
3. Identify any divergences

### Fuzzing

Use fuzzing techniques to discover edge cases:

1. Generate random but valid scripts
2. Execute in both implementations
3. Compare results and behavior
4. Focus on areas where differences are found

## Test Automation Strategy

### Continuous Integration

- Run unit tests on every commit
- Run integration tests nightly
- Run full compatibility test suite weekly

### Test Coverage

- Measure test coverage of the Rust implementation
- Identify and address coverage gaps
- Prioritize coverage of critical paths

### Performance Testing

- Benchmark key operations
- Compare performance between implementations
- Identify optimization opportunities

## Test Documentation

### Test Case Structure

Each test case should include:

1. Description of tested behavior
2. Input data
3. Expected output
4. Edge cases covered
5. Known limitations

### Test Coverage Reports

Regular test coverage reports should include:

1. Overall coverage percentage
2. Coverage by component
3. Identified gaps
4. Mitigation plans

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Unit Test Development

- Implement unit tests for all Rust VM components
- Achieve high code coverage of core functionality
- Verify basic behaviors against C# implementation

### Phase 2: Integration Test Development

- Develop component integration tests
- Verify component interactions
- Implement cross-implementation test framework

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing

- Develop script execution tests
- Implement snapshot testing
- Begin fuzzing operations

### Phase 4: Continuous Validation

- Integrate tests into CI/CD pipelines
- Implement automated comparison with C# implementation
- Develop regression test suite

## Special Testing Considerations

### Memory Management

- Test reference counting behavior
- Verify memory cleanup on context unloading
- Test circular reference handling

### Numeric Operations

- Test large integer operations
- Verify overflow handling
- Test edge cases for numeric conversions

### Exception Handling

- Verify consistent exception generation
- Test exception propagation
- Verify VM state after exceptions

## Test Success Criteria

The Rust VM implementation is considered validated when:

1. All test cases pass with identical results to the C# implementation
2. Code coverage reaches >95% for core VM components
3. No memory leaks are detected in extended operation
4. Performance is within acceptable thresholds compared to C# implementation
