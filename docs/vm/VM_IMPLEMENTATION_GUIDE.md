# Neo VM Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the architecture, design principles, and implementation details for the Neo VM in Rust. It serves as the authoritative reference for developers working on the Neo VM implementation, ensuring consistency with the C# reference implementation.

## Architecture

The Neo VM follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```

```

## Core Components

### OpCode

The OpCode module defines all instructions supported by the Neo VM. Each OpCode corresponds to a specific VM operation.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- OpCode values must match the C# implementation exactly
- Operand size information must be preserved
- Methods for stack effects analysis must be implemented

### Stack Items

Stack items represent values in the Neo VM, with various types for different data representations.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- All stack item types from the C# implementation must be supported
- Value semantics must be preserved, including deep cloning and equality
- Type conversion logic must match the C# implementation

### Execution Engine

The execution engine is the heart of the VM, responsible for instruction execution and state management.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Support for invocation stack management
- Context loading and unloading
- Instruction execution via jump table
- Exception handling
- Reference counting for memory management

### Interop Service

The interop service provides a bridge between the VM and the host system.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Interface for registering interop methods
- Support for method invocation with parameter validation
- Same interop method identifiers as C# implementation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Structure and Basic Functionality

1. Ensure OpCode definitions match exactly with C# implementation
2. Implement stack item types with basic operations
3. Implement reference counting mechanism
4. Set up basic execution engine and context management

### Phase 2: Instruction Implementation

1. Implement jump table structure
2. Implement handlers for all OpCodes
3. Add support for branching and control flow
4. Implement exception handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. Implement interop service layer
2. Add support for dynamic invocation
3. Implement debugging capabilities
4. Add performance optimizations

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

1. Develop comprehensive unit tests
2. Implement integration tests that match C# behavior
3. Create cross-implementation validation tests
4. Performance benchmarking

## Behavioral Requirements

### Stack Management

- Stack overflow/underflow checks must match C# implementation
- Stack item limits must be enforced identically

### Memory Management

- Reference counting must prevent memory leaks
- Circular references must be handled correctly

### Error Handling

- Exception types and messages should match C# implementation
- VM state transitions must be consistent with C# implementation

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Testing

- Each VM component should have comprehensive unit tests
- Edge cases should be explicitly tested

### Integration Testing

- Tests should validate entire execution flows
- Script execution results must match C# implementation
- Test coverage should aim for 100% of public API

### Compatibility Testing

- Cross-implementation tests should use the same scripts
- Results must be identical between C# and Rust implementations

## Performance Considerations

- Critical execution paths should be optimized
- Memory allocation should be minimized
- Large integer operations should be benchmarked and optimized
- Avoid unnecessary cloning of stack items
