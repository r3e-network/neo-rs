# Neo VM Compatibility Updates - Status Report

This document outlines the progress of updating the Rust VM implementation to exactly match the C# reference implementation. It serves as a living specification for the compatibility requirements and implementation status.

## Critical Updates - Progress Summary

### 1. VMState Implementation

**Status**: âœ… Completed

The VMState enum has been updated to match the C# implementation exactly:

```rust
#[repr(u8)]
pub enum VMState {
    /// The VM is not running.
    NONE = 0,

    /// The VM has halted normally.
    HALT = 1,

    /// The VM has encountered an error.
    FAULT = 2,

    /// The VM is in a debug break state.
    BREAK = 4,
}
```

### 2. JumpTable Implementation

**Status**: âœ… Completed

#### Updates Implemented:
- Converted from HashMap to array-based implementation to match C# exactly
- Updated all accessor methods to use array indexing instead of HashMap lookup
- Implemented proper Index/IndexMut trait implementations for array-based access
- Updated all handler registration code to work with the array-based approach

```rust
pub struct JumpTable {
    /// The handlers for each opcode (fixed-size array of 256 entries)
    handlers: [Option<InstructionHandler>; 256],
}

impl JumpTable {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let mut jump_table = Self {
            handlers: [None; 256],
        };
        
        // Register default handlers
        jump_table.register_default_handlers();
        
        jump_table
    }
    
    /// Gets the handler for an opcode (C# equivalent: indexer get)
    pub fn get_handler(&self, opcode: OpCode) -> Option<InstructionHandler> {
        self.handlers[opcode as usize]
    }
    
    /// Sets the handler for an opcode (C# equivalent: indexer set)
    pub fn set_handler(&mut self, opcode: OpCode, handler: InstructionHandler) {
        self.handlers[opcode as usize] = Some(handler);
    }
}
```

### 3. ExecutionContext Implementation

**Status**: âœ… Completed

#### Updates Implemented:
- Implemented SharedStates struct matching the C# implementation exactly
- Updated ExecutionContext to use SharedStates for script, evaluation stack, and static fields
- Updated all accessor methods to work through SharedStates
- Ensured field types and access patterns match C# exactly

```rust
pub struct SharedStates {
    script: Script,
    evaluation_stack: EvaluationStack,
    static_fields: Option<Slot>,
}

pub struct ExecutionContext {
    shared_states: SharedStates,
    instruction_pointer: usize,
    rvcount: i32,
    local_variables: Option<Slot>,
    arguments: Option<Slot>,
    try_stack: Option<Vec<ExceptionHandlingContext>>,
}
```

### 4. Exception Handling Implementation

**Status**: âœ… Completed

#### Updates Implemented:
- Updated ExceptionHandlingState enum to match C# exactly, including documentation
- Updated ExceptionHandlingContext struct with identical field types and visibility
- Changed integer types from isize to i32 to match C# implementation
- Added comprehensive testing for exception handling behavior

```rust
#[repr(u8)]
pub enum ExceptionHandlingState {
    /// Indicates that the try block is being executed.
    Try,

    /// Indicates that the catch block is being executed.
    Catch,

    /// Indicates that the finally block is being executed.
    Finally,
}

pub struct ExceptionHandlingContext {
    /// The position of the catch block.
    pub catch_pointer: i32,

    /// The position of the finally block.
    pub finally_pointer: i32,

    /// The end position of the try-catch-finally block.
    pub end_pointer: i32,

    /// The current state of exception handling.
    pub state: ExceptionHandlingState,
    
    // Additional Rust-specific fields (private to maintain API compatibility)
    exception: Option<StackItem>,
}
```

### 5. Stack Item Implementation

**Status**: âœ… Matches Exactly

The stack item types in both C# and Rust implementations match exactly, including:
- Enum values and ordering
- Type conversion logic
- Comparison operations

### 6. OpCode Implementation

**Status**: âœ… Matches Exactly

The OpCode enum values match exactly between C# and Rust implementations.

## Cross-Implementation Verification

### 1. Testing Framework

**Status**: âœ… Implemented

Implemented a comprehensive testing framework for verifying identical behavior between the C# and Rust VMs:

- Created test infrastructure in `tests/vm_compatibility_tests.rs`
- Implemented exception handling tests in `tests/exception_handling_compatibility_tests.rs`
- Added script-based verification approach for comparing execution results

### 2. Verification Testing

**Status**: ðŸ”„ Ongoing

Currently implementing comprehensive test cases to verify identical behavior:

- Basic arithmetic operations tests: âœ… Completed
- Control flow operations tests: âœ… Completed
- Exception handling tests: âœ… Completed
- Stack manipulation tests: âœ… Completed
- Type conversion tests: ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Complex script tests: ðŸ”„ In Progress

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Complete Cross-Implementation Testing

**Priority**: High

Expand the test suite to cover all opcode handlers and ensure identical behavior between implementations.

### 2. Document Intentional Differences

**Priority**: Medium

Document any intentional differences between the implementations, particularly related to Rust-specific optimizations or language features.

### 3. Performance Optimization

**Priority**: Low

After ensuring functional compatibility, implement Rust-specific performance optimizations while maintaining identical behavior.

## Conclusion

The Rust VM implementation now closely matches the C# reference implementation in all critical areas. The VM state, instruction handling, exception management, and execution context all follow the same patterns and behavior as the C# implementation. Ongoing testing and verification will ensure complete compatibility is maintained.
