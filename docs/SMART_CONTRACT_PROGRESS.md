All tests focus on core functionality and can run independently of VM integration.

## Current Limitations

### 1. VM Integration Blocked
- **Issue**: VM module has 350+ compilation errors
- **Impact**: ApplicationEngine integration cannot be completed
- **Workaround**: Implemented placeholder ApplicationEngine for testing

### 2. Incomplete Native Contract Logic
- **Status**: Framework complete, business logic placeholder
- **Reason**: Requires storage integration and blockchain state access
- **Next Step**: Implement actual token balances and governance logic

### 3. Contract Deployment
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Dependencies**: Requires VM integration and storage persistence
- **Scope**: Contract creation, update, and destruction operations

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Fix VM Module Compilation Issues
- Resolve 350+ compilation errors in VM module
- Focus on core VM functionality needed for smart contracts
- Enable ApplicationEngine integration

### 2. Complete ApplicationEngine Integration
- Integrate with fixed VM module
- Implement contract execution context
- Add blockchain state access

### 3. Implement Complete Native Contract Logic
- Add actual storage operations for token balances
- Implement governance mechanisms
- Add committee and candidate management

### 4. Add Contract Management Operations
- Contract deployment (Create)
- Contract updates (Update)
- Contract destruction (Destroy)

### 5. Integration Testing
- End-to-end contract execution tests
- Cross-module integration validation
- Performance benchmarking

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Modular Design
- Clear separation between manifest, storage, interop, and native components
- Trait-based interfaces for extensibility
- Minimal dependencies between components

### 2. Rust Idioms
- Ownership and borrowing for memory safety
- Result types for error handling
- Iterator patterns for collections
- Type safety for all operations

### 3. C# Compatibility
- Exact API compatibility where possible
- Same serialization formats
- Identical gas costs and validation rules

## Conclusion

The Smart Contract module foundation is solid and well-tested. The main blocker is the VM module compilation issues, which need to be resolved to complete the integration. Once the VM is fixed, the remaining work involves implementing business logic and completing the ApplicationEngine integration.

The implemented components follow Neo N3 specifications exactly and provide a strong foundation for the complete smart contract execution environment.
