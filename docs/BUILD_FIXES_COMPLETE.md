# Neo-RS Build Fixes Complete

## Summary
Successfully fixed all compilation errors in the Neo-RS project. The entire workspace now builds successfully with `cargo build --release`.

## Errors Fixed

### 1. E0425 Errors (52 total) - Cannot find value
**Root Cause**: Automated documentation fixing script inadvertently renamed variables by adding underscores.

**Fixed Files**:
- `crates/network/src/rpc.rs` - Fixed 15+ handler functions changing `_state` to `state`
- `crates/network/src/messages/network.rs` - Fixed `_checksum` to `checksum`
- `crates/network/src/peer_manager.rs` - Fixed `_event_sender` to `event_sender`
- `crates/network/src/server.rs` - Fixed `_rpc_server` to `rpc_server` and `_sync_manager` to `sync_manager`

### 2. E0521 Error - Borrowed data escapes
**File**: `crates/network/src/server.rs`
**Issue**: `self` reference escaping in async spawned task
**Fix**: Changed `_sync_manager` to `sync_manager` to properly clone before moving into async block

### 3. E0432 Errors - Unresolved imports
**File**: `crates/network/src/lib.rs`
**Issue**: Trying to import non-existent constants from neo_config
**Fix**: Removed invalid imports, defined constants locally:
```rust
const DEFAULT_MAINNET_PORT: &str = "10333";
const DEFAULT_PRIVNET_PORT: &str = "30333";
const DEFAULT_WS_PORT: &str = "10334";
```

### 4. E0277 Errors - Missing Debug trait
**File**: `crates/persistence/src/rocksdb/mod.rs`
**Issue**: RocksDbStore didn't implement Debug trait required by RPC server
**Fix**: Added `#[derive(Debug)]` to RocksDbStore struct
