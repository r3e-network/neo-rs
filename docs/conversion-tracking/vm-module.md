# Neo VM Module Conversion Tracking

This document tracks the progress of converting the Neo VM implementation from C# to Rust.

## Overview

The Neo VM (Virtual Machine) is responsible for executing smart contracts on the Neo blockchain. It provides a stack-based virtual machine that can execute Neo smart contract bytecode. The VM implementation is being converted from C# to Rust as part of the Neo-rs project.

## Conversion Status

|-----------|--------|-------|
| OpCode | ✅ Complete | Implemented enum representation of VM operation codes |
| OperandSize | ✅ Complete | Implemented operand size descriptor |
| Script | ✅ Complete | Implemented script representation and validation |
| Instruction | ✅ Complete | Implemented bytecode instruction parsing and representation |
| ReferenceCounter | ✅ Complete | Implemented reference counting for memory management |

| EvaluationStack | ✅ Complete | Implemented evaluation stack for VM execution |
| ExecutionContext | ✅ Complete | Implemented execution context and slot for variables |
| JumpTable | ✅ Complete | Implemented instruction dispatch table |
| ExecutionEngine | ✅ Complete | Implemented VM core for script execution |
| InteropService | ✅ Complete | Implemented interoperability with external systems |
| ScriptBuilder | ✅ Complete | Implemented programmatic script construction |
| ApplicationEngine | ✅ Complete | Implemented Neo blockchain-specific VM functionality |

## Issues and Challenges

- Ensuring proper memory management with reference counting in Rust
- Maintaining compatibility with the C# implementation
- Handling circular references and garbage collection
- Rust's type system requires different approaches for certain patterns used in C#
