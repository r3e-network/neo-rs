- FIXME, XXX, HACK comments absent
- TODO comments within limit (1 found, max 5)
- No multiple empty lines
- No unused imports
- Snake case function names correct
- Public functions/structs documented
- No TypeScript 'any' types
- Unsafe blocks have safety comments
- No Git dependencies
- No hardcoded credentials

#### ❌ Failed Checks (13/30):
1. **println! statements**: 67 occurrences found
2. **print! statements**: 2 occurrences found
3. **panic! in production**: 28 occurrences found
4. **unwrap() usage**: 1,453 occurrences found
5. **Commented out code**: 1,036 occurrences found
6. **Wildcard imports**: 212 occurrences found
7. **Magic number 15**: 57 occurrences found
8. **Magic number 262144**: 10 occurrences found
9. **Magic number 102400**: 34 occurrences found
10. **CamelCase variable names**: 1,075 occurrences found
11. **Multiple public items in mod.rs**: 10 occurrences found
12. **Path dependencies**: 52 occurrences found
13. **Hardcoded IP addresses**: 25 occurrences found

#### ⚠️ Warnings (2/30):
- **Long functions**: 51 found (max allowed: 10)
- **Large files**: 18 found (max allowed: 5)

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Production Readiness Blockers:
- Implement version retrieval endpoint
- Fix error logging and warning systems
- Clean up multiple data directories
- Complete P2P functionality for full node operation

### 2. Code Consistency Critical Issues:
- **1,453 unwrap() calls** - Major stability risk
- **67 println! statements** - Should use proper logging
- **28 panic! statements** - Will crash in production
- **1,036 commented code blocks** - Code clutter

### 3. Security Concerns:
- 25 hardcoded IP addresses
- Potential for panic-based DoS attacks

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. Replace all unwrap() with proper error handling
2. Remove all println! and use log crate
3. Replace panic! with Result returns
4. Clean up commented code
5. Replace magic numbers with constants

### Short-term Improvements:
1. Refactor long functions (51 functions > 100 lines)
2. Fix wildcard imports
3. Clean up variable naming (CamelCase issues)
4. Consolidate duplicate error types

### Long-term Goals:
1. Achieve 100% consistency score
2. Implement missing P2P features
3. Add comprehensive error tracking
4. Reduce file sizes and complexity

## Progress Made

Despite the issues found, significant improvements have been made:
- Created error handling utilities
- Defined constants for magic numbers
- Implemented TODO items
- Improved logging in many areas

## Conclusion

Neo-RS is making good progress but requires focused effort on:
1. **Error handling** - Remove unwrap() and panic!
2. **Code cleanup** - Remove debug statements and commented code
3. **Production hardening** - Complete P2P implementation

Current state is suitable for development and testing but not for production deployment.
