# Integration Test Implementation Notes

## Current Status

The integration test suite has been created with comprehensive test coverage for all major Neo blockchain components. However, the tests need to be adapted to match the actual APIs of the neo-rs implementation.

## API Adjustments Needed

### 1. Module Imports
Many modules referenced in the tests may not exist yet or have different names:
- `neo_node::Node` - May need to use the actual node implementation
- `neo_rpc_client::RpcClient` - Check if RPC client exists
- `neo_smart_contract::ApplicationEngine` - Verify smart contract module structure

### 2. Type Definitions
Several types need verification:
- `ValidatorConfig` structure fields
- `ConsensusConfig` fields (missing `validators`, has `validator_count` instead)
- `Signer` requires additional fields: `allowed_contracts`, `allowed_groups`, `rules`
- `Witness` constructor is private, needs proper initialization

### 3. Method Signatures
- `UInt160::from_str()` doesn't exist, may need `UInt160::from()` or parse method
- Various async methods may have different signatures
- Transaction and Block construction APIs need verification

## How to Fix

1. **Start with simple tests**: Begin by fixing compilation in one test file at a time
2. **Check actual APIs**: Look at the actual implementation to understand correct usage
3. **Create mock implementations**: For missing components, create mocks or stubs
4. **Gradual integration**: As more components are implemented, replace mocks with real implementations

## Test Categories Status

- **P2P Tests**: Need `Node` and networking API verification
- **Consensus Tests**: Need `DbftEngine` and consensus API verification  
- **Sync Tests**: Need `SyncManager` implementation verification
- **Execution Tests**: Need `ApplicationEngine` and VM integration
- **End-to-End Tests**: Depend on all other components working

## Next Steps

1. Fix compilation errors by adapting to actual APIs
2. Create minimal mock implementations for missing components
3. Run tests against actual implementation as it develops
4. Update tests as APIs evolve

## Benefits

Even with compilation errors, these tests provide:
- Clear specification of expected behavior
- Test-driven development guidance
- Integration points documentation
- Performance benchmarks to target

The tests serve as both verification tools and documentation of how the system should work when fully implemented.
