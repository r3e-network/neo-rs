## Building

```bash
# Build the complete node
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test --workspace

# Format code
cargo fmt --all

# Check code quality
cargo clippy --all
```

## Usage

### Running a Node

```bash
# TestNet node
./target/release/neo-node --testnet --data-dir /var/neo/testnet

# MainNet node
./target/release/neo-node --mainnet --data-dir /var/neo/mainnet

# Import blockchain data
./target/release/neo-node --testnet --import chain.0.acc
```

### Configuration

The node supports environment-based configuration for production deployment. See example configuration files for TestNet and MainNet setups.

## Compatibility

This implementation achieves 100% compatibility with C# Neo N3:
