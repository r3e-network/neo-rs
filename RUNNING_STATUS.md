# Neo-Rust Node Running Status

## Current Status âœ…

The Neo-Rust node is successfully running on testnet with the following configuration:

- **RPC Endpoint**: http://localhost:30332/rpc (Working)
- **P2P Port**: 30333 (Configured)
- **Process ID**: 22413
- **Current Block Height**: 1 (Genesis block only)

## Management

Use the provided management script for easy control:

```bash
# Check status
./scripts/neo-node-manager.sh status

# View logs
./scripts/neo-node-manager.sh logs

# Test RPC
./scripts/neo-node-manager.sh test

# Stop node
./scripts/neo-node-manager.sh stop

# Start node
./scripts/neo-node-manager.sh start

# Restart node
./scripts/neo-node-manager.sh restart
```

## Docker Setup (Ready for Use)

When Docker is available, you can use the prepared configurations:

1. **Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build with all dependencies
2. **docker-compose.testnet.yml**: Simple testnet deployment
3. **DOCKER_INSTRUCTIONS.md**: Complete Docker usage guide

To use Docker when available:
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t neo-rs:testnet .

# Run with docker-compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.testnet.yml up -d
```

## Known Issues

1. **P2P Synchronization**: The node currently only has the genesis block. Full synchronization requires:
   - Proper seed node connections
   - Network manager implementation
   - Blockchain sync protocol

2. **Port Conflicts**: Original testnet ports (20332, 20333) were in use, so we're using alternative ports (30332, 30333)

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the logs to see if P2P connections are established
2. Implement missing network manager functionality for peer discovery
3. Add blockchain synchronization logic
4. Set up monitoring and metrics collection

## Testing the Node

You can interact with the node using RPC:

```bash
# Get node version
curl -X POST http://localhost:30332/rpc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"getversion","params":[],"id":1}'

# Get current block count
curl -X POST http://localhost:30332/rpc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"getblockcount","params":[],"id":1}'

# Get blockchain state
curl -X POST http://localhost:30332/rpc \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"getblockchainstate","params":[],"id":1}'
```

The node is operational and ready for further development!
